PigScript Special Build -- Silver Bullet!
Please help me improve the code!
My email: pigscript@gmail.com

Tested work on windows 7 & 8 on chrome browser.
Screen resolution may matter, so draw a small test picture first.
New in SB: add 'silver bullet' command to destroy the pink color.
New in 1.5: can draw beautiful curves.
New in 1.4: can preview the output image and control its color accuracy, improved color rendering, can manually recover if the position anchor (barcodes) is vandalized, enables ink-saving mode.

How to draw:
    0. Switch to drawball.com, enable full screen, and choose the pen size.
    1. Run the code or the .exe file.
    2. Follow the instructions on the command line.

Details about the command line options(to be finished...):
    1. Draw a local picture

    2. Draw a website picture
	
    3. Draw curves
	
    4. Silver Bullet
        What is this:
            This command will draw white lines on the pink zones which the BLUE team is spamming.
            Though it will not completely wipe out those pink color, it is enough to annoy them.
            Due to data compression of the ball, the resulting image will eventually have a greyish color.
        How to use:
            Please use this command only when your computer is idle, and have enough ink(>3000).
            i) Zoom in to a zone on the left of the ball, and set your pen size between 1-4.
            ii) Press any key to start.
	
    5. Exit
	
Caution:
    0. It's recomended that you set your pen size(manually, the program won't do that) to be 1 or 2. If you set your pen size to be x, the output image will be scaled by x.
    1. Make sure the command window does not block the color wheel.
    2. If the image is large(>600*600), it may take several seconds to load.
    3. If the image is too large or too complicated, it may take very long to draw.
    4. If your screen resolution is not 1280*800 or 1366*768, you need to help the program to locate the big ball and the color wheel.
